Alright, what is this? Well, let me ask you a question before we start. Have you ever played Terraria, Minecraft on your own server (or any other game, where someone hosts the server and others just connect to him) with your friends? I guess the answer is yes. If so then the next situation should be known for you: you want to play, but host is offline. That's sad, right? This program should fix this problem. Hopefully xD

Furthermore, let's say you're using Cloud Storage(s) a lot. You know that you must leave your files in the specific Cloud Folder on your computer. You think that it's very uncomfortable? And so do I! Moreover, you can't store some files in this folder permanently, thus you're used to copy and paste them over and over again. Stop this frustration! Get my program now.

Features:
1. Creating BackUps (and a BackUp folder if needed). You won't lose your file even if something goes wrong.
2. "Sleep" mode - no unnecessary CPU load

To-do list:
1. Interface
2. Minimization to tray ability
3. Proper program name. For the time being it's horrible xD
