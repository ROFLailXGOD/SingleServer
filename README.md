Alright, what is this? Well let me ask you a question before we start. Have you ever played Terraria, Minecraft (on your own server) or any other game, where someone hosts the server and others just connecting to him with your friends? I guess the answer is yes. If so then you should know next situation: you want to play, but host is offline. That's sad, right? This program should fix this problem. Hopefully xD

Planned features:
Creating BackUps (and a BackUp folder if needed) âœ”
Finding a proper process to work with
"Sleep" mode
